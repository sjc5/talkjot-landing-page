        Easy On The Brain
      </h3>
      <p>
        Typing on a mobile device is a total buzzkill. Talking into your device for simple notes and self-reminders is much more natural. It's a bit like asking the butler to write out a note for you and set it on the counter. 😜

        Actually Find Your Notes Again
      </h3>
      <p>
        Notes and reminders sent to your own personal email address are much more likely to actually be found and acted upon than notes stored in a random notes app or notebook! Take your "notes to self" to the next level with TalkJot.
