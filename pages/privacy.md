<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

In general, TalkJot does not collect or store any information about users. This website does not use tracking or cookies, and our app is designed such that all of your information, including personal information, stays hidden from us.

When you use our app, your email address is stored on your local device. When you send an email that was created with our app, you are using your own email account on your own email app on your own device. Neither your email address nor your notes are ever sent to us unless you specifically do so yourself (such as by sending us a screenshot or support request). If you wish to send us a support request without identifying yourself, that is perfectly fine. In that case, just use a throwaway email address, and be careful not to include any identifying information in your email to us.

If, however, you do send us an email that includes personal information, we may collect and store that data. We will not, however, spam you or sell your email address.

Our app uses third-party speech recognition services (as are built into your device) and third-party email apps (again, as are built into your device). The privacy policies of those respective third parties will apply to your use of such services.

In general, we would like to encourage all of our users to take measures in their personal lives to protect their privacy and security, such as by using VPNs, avoiding companies that collect and sell their data, and by using reputable password managers and 2FA on all user accounts.

TalkJot and its creator hereby disclaim any and all liablity stemming from or in any way related to your use of this website or the TalkJot app.

If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to reach out to us at hello@talkjot.co.
